# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. It differes from traditional programming as it is broader and allows collaborations fron different platforms. 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
SDLC comprises of the following phasees.
-Planning; Which is the establishment of the scope and purpose of the project
-Requirement Analysis; Documenting what the enduser or stakeholders needs from the software.
-Design; To cleate the blueprint of the software system.
-Implementation; To build a software code based on the design specification.
-Testing; Identify and fix defects in the software
-Deployment; Realising the software to users. 
-Maintenance; Ensuring the softwares efficacy and functions are correct
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Both Agile and Waterfall models have their own strgnths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of projects. 
-Agile if preferred for projects requiring flexibility and continous customer interaction like in the banking industry.
-Waterfall is used in projects with stable requirements and a need for detailed documentation. HR and SAP use this method
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement Engineering is a systematic process in software development to define, document, and maintain the requirements for a system. It is important as it identifies the needs and constraints of various stakeholders so fine tuning can be made to meet those needs.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity improves maintainability and scalability as it breaks down systems into smaller, managable components, thus making it easier to manage by isolating changes, simplifying testing, and providing clearer structures. It also enables independant development, incremental growth, load distribution and flexible deployment through scaling. 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Unit testing; Testing individual components, ensuring they work as intended. It focuses on the smallest parts of an application to verify correctness and catch bugs early.
-Integration testing; Testing the intergration between integrad unit/modules to ensure they work together correctly and identify issues in the interface and inrteractions between modules.
-System testing;Testing the complete and integrated sysyem to verify it meets the specified requirements often performed in an environment that mirrors the production. By that validating the systems overall behaviour and performance, and ensuring all componenets work together in the context of the entire system.
-Acceptance testing; Conducted testing to determine if the system meets the requirements and is ready for deployment.

The importance of Software testing is to determine the readiness of the product and fine tune it to meet the desired results and specifications.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems track the progress of code across the SDLC and its multiple iteration which maintains a record of every change complete with authorship, timestamp, and other details,  and also aids in managing change.
Examples of popular Version control system include but not limited to GIT, IBM, STASH, Azure etc.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager plays a crucial role in ensuring that software projects are completed successfully, meeting stakeholder expectations, within budget and schedule constraints. They must possess strong leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills to navigate the complexities of software development and effectively manage teams and resources.
He must plan and schdule, do resource management, budget management, risk management, stakeholder communication, quality assurance, and lead and motivate his team, and also monitoring and controlling.
Challenges he might face include; Resource constraints, time management, changing scopes, communication, risk management, quality control, team dynamics, stakeholder requirements, and technology changes.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt the software to a changed environment. It is an essential part of the software lifecycle because software, like any other product, requires ongoing care to remain functional, efficient, and relevant to changing user needs and technological environments. 

Types of Software Maintenance

-Corrective Maintenance
-Adaptive Maintenance
-Perfective Maintenance
-Preventive Maintenance

Importance of Maintenance in the Software Lifecycle

-Prolongs Software Life
-Improves Performance and Reliability:
-Adaptability to Change
-Cost Efficiency:
-User Satisfaction: 
-Compliance and Security

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Common ethical issues software engineers face include:
-Privacy and data protection
-Security
-Intellectual Property
-Transparency and honesty
-Bias and fairness
-Responsibility and accountability 
-Work place ethics

for the engineer to ensure adherance to ethical standards he needs to actively consider the ethical issues and implementing strategies to address them.
